# Nikhil Bhagwat

I am a post-doc at McGill University working with [Dr. Jean-Baptiste Poline](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd) in the [ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) lab. My current work focuses on improving reproducibility and sustainability of computational neuroimaging pipelines. I completed my PhD thesis on prognostic applications for Alzheimer’s disease using MR imaging and machine-learning techniques under [Dr. Mallar Chakravarty](http://cobralab.ca/members/commander/) at the University of Toronto. Subsequently, I worked as a researcher on a collaborative project between McGill and UMass universities on computational pipelines to perform methodological vibration analysis and improve reproducibility. I then went on to work at the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/), where I developed segmentation techniques and network spread models for quantifying cellular pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease in high-resolution microscopy data. I am an open-science enthusiast, and have been involved in several workshops and [educational courses](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/SDC-BIDS-sMRI). My diverse work experiences over the last few years have made me increasingly aware of the environmental and ecological impact of neuroimaging pipelines stemming from exponential growth of computational research - making it the current focus of my work.
