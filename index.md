# _Nikhil Bhagwat_

I am a computational neuroscientist with industry and academic research experience in neuroimaging and machine-learning. I am interested in development of robust biomarkers and machine-learning models for prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases. Currently I focus on development of neuroinformatic tools and implementation of reproducible computational workflows to assess and improve replication of imaging biomarkers and ML models. Concurrently, I am also involved in open-science and data harmonization projects relating to curation of diverse, open datasets representative of global populations. 

At present, I am working with [Dr. Jean-Baptiste Poline](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd) in the [ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) lab at McGill University. I completed my PhD thesis on prognostic applications for Alzheimer’s disease using MR imaging and machine-learning techniques under [Dr. Mallar Chakravarty](http://cobralab.ca/members/commander/) at the University of Toronto. Subsequently, I worked as a researcher on a collaborative project between McGill and UMass universities assessing reproducibility of computational pipelines estimating cortical surfaces measures. I then went on to work at the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/), where I developed segmentation techniques and network spread models for quantifying cellular pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease in high-resolution microscopy data. 

Within the larger research community, I am involved in multiple open-science and sustainable-neuroimaging initiatives. I develop and teach several "open" workshops (e.g. [MAIN](https://main-educational.github.io/intro.html) and [educational courses](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/SDC-BIDS-sMRI). I am also a current treasurer for the [Sustainability & Environmental Action SIG](https://ohbm-environment.org/) within the [Organisation for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM)](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1) working on promoting sustainable research practices and conferencing.
